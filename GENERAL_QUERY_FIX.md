# Fix: General Query Support

## Problem Identified ✅
The enhanced recommendation system was too focused on mechanic matching and would return empty results for general queries like:
- "fun games for date night"
- "something strategic for 4 players" 
- "family games"
- "party games"

## Root Cause
The system was:
1. Only triggering broad search when fewer than 5 games were found from mechanic searches
2. Requiring specific complexity/theme/player hints to return anything in broad search
3. Not providing a good fallback for completely general queries

## Solution Implemented ✅

### 1. **Enhanced Broad Search Logic** (`lib/enhanced-database.ts`)
- Now triggers when fewer than **10** games found (was 5)
- Added **category detection** for common query types (family, party, strategy, etc.)
- Added **diverse game selection** when no specific criteria match
- Always returns games even for completely general queries

### 2. **Improved Scoring System** (`app/api/recommend/route.ts`)
- Added base quality scores for well-regarded games
- Enhanced tag matching for general categories
- Better player count and complexity preference detection
- Every game gets at least 1 point (ensures something is always returned)

### 3. **General Query Pitch Generation**
Added context-aware pitches for common general requests:
- Family games: "family bonding without the usual educational torture sessions"
- Date games: "date night just got significantly more interesting and revealing"
- Party games: "your social gatherings need this kind of controlled chaos"
- Strategy games: "brain-burning strategy for people who think they're actually strategic"

### 4. **Category Detection**
New function `extractCategoryFromPrompt()` maps common language to game categories:
- "family", "kids", "parents" → family games
- "party", "social", "group" → party games  
- "strategy", "strategic", "thinking" → strategic games
- "date", "romantic", "couple" → 2-player games
- "quick", "fast", "short" → quick games

## Expected Behavior Now

### General Query Example:
```
User: "fun games for date night"

Enhanced Flow:
1. Extract mechanics: none found
2. Extract categories: ["date"] 
3. Search for games tagged with couple-friendly, 2-player, etc.
4. Apply diverse selection algorithm
5. Score based on 2-player support, complexity, themes
6. Return 3-5 well-matched games with custom pitches

Result: Always returns games, even for vague queries
```

### Mechanic Query (Still Works):
```
User: "worker placement games"

Enhanced Flow:  
1. Extract mechanics: ["worker-placement"]
2. Find games with exact mechanic matches
3. Return games that actually have worker placement
4. Validate claimed mechanics

Result: Accurate mechanic-based recommendations
```

## Testing

### Test General Queries:
```bash
npx tsx test-general-queries.ts
```

This tests 9 common general query patterns and ensures each returns games.

### Test Through API:
```bash
# Start server
npm run dev

# Test general queries
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/recommend \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "fun games for date night"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/recommend \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "something strategic"}'
```

## Key Improvements

### Reliability:
- **100% query satisfaction**: Every query now returns games
- **Graceful degradation**: Falls back through multiple search strategies
- **Diverse results**: Variety across themes and complexities

### User Experience:
- **Handles vague queries**: "something fun" now works
- **Context-aware pitches**: Personalized recommendations based on query type
- **No empty results**: Users always get suggestions

### Maintainability:
- **Modular category detection**: Easy to add new query patterns
- **Comprehensive logging**: Easy to debug what's happening
- **Fallback layers**: Multiple safety nets prevent empty results

## Files Modified
- ✅ `lib/enhanced-database.ts` - Improved broad search logic
- ✅ `app/api/recommend/route.ts` - Better scoring and pitch generation
- ✅ `test-general-queries.ts` - Test suite for general queries

The system now gracefully handles both specific mechanic requests AND general gaming queries, providing accurate recommendations in both cases.
